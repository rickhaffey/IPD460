## Business Process

**Emergent Care Services** is an ambulance service that provides basic and
advanced life support (BLS/ALS) for the local EMS system. Emergent wants to
implement a company-wide quality improvement program. 

Emergent has historically had challenges and concerns around their units' call
response times.  They are also interested in gaining a better understanding of
the level of service currently being provided with respect to cardiac care.

As a result, they are interested in implementing a reporting system that sends:
	1. a daily email to the field operations manager containing response time
	metrics for the previous 24-hour period, and
	1. a monthly email to the clinical coordinator containing cardiac care
	metrics for the previous month.

The users of these reports will drill down into the detailed data underlying the
summaries (by region, unit, call type, time period, etc.) and view trending of
data at various levels of detail. The users generate reports for multiple views
of the data, in support of activities such as:

	* issue identification
	* root cause analysis
	* goal setting
	* operational planning
	* crew feedback and coaching

* The metrics of interest are based on performance measures established by the
  NHTSA. They include:
	* Average and 90th Percentile Response Time
	* Average and 90th Percentile Scene Time
	* Average and 90th Percentile Transport Time
	* Average and 90th Percentile Defibrillation Time
	* Average and 90th Percentile Initial Rhythm Analysis Time
